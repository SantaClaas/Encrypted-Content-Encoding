# Encrypted Content-Encoding

Some code to help implementing Encrypted Content-Encoding in F#.

This is from when I completely derailed a side project because I wanted to use Web Push Notifications but I couldn't find any implementations I liked so I made my own based on the RFC.

I created this repository for myself to easier find the ECE code. The original repository is (private) [Timer](https://github.com/santaclaas/timer). But that is hard to find if I search for ECE hence this repository.
